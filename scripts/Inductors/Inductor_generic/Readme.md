Generic generator for inductor footprints. Use it to exactly duplicate the suggested footprint given in the datasheet (as opposed to the IPC generators which do not rely on the suggested footprint).

It supports generating footprints for inductors with rectangular base and possibly chamfered, rounded or cut out corners. (Example TDK SLF6028)
