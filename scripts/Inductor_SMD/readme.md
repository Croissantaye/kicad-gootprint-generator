# gen_inductor.py
## Usage
`python gen_inductor.py <inputfile.yaml> <outputPath>`

## Intent
The goal was to easily copy and paste datasheet information for inductor series to generate the
appropriate footprints. In the specific case, Sunlord has a certain format (describe in CSV section below)
that did not suit the existing Inductor_SMD script format.

The workflow that has worked well for me is as follows
1. Use Foxit PDF to copy the specifications table.
1. Paste this in the spreadsheet editor of your choice
1. Delete the columns which aren't required
1. Rename the headers and perform any other editing or grouping required (eg. regex `# Â±[\d\. ]*` is useful to match tolerances and delete)
1. Export to CSV format

## YAML input file
The yaml file is used to define all the series inputs. The `3d` section is needed if the file will be used with the the `kicad-packages3D-generator` script.

- series: Name of the series
- manufacturer: Name of the series
- datasheet: Optional. URL of the datasheet. If you do not specify it here, then **make sure to specify it** in the CSV using `datasheetUrl`.
- landingSpacing: Optional. Defaults to `edge` for edge-to-edge spacing for copper landing. Can be set to `center` if datasheet uses center-to-center dimensions.
- csv: Filename for the CSV file. Should not have a path prepended.
-   3d: Optional.
    - type: Optional. 
        * 1 - Rectangle body, rectangle pads on the bottom surface. For stronger rounded corners, set `cornerRadius` below.
        * 2 - Rectangle body, rectangle pads on the bottom surface, with visible wings on the sides
        
    - bodyColor: Optional. Default to `black body`.
    - pinColor: Optional. Default to `metal grey pins`
    - padThickness: Optional. Default to `0.05` mm.
    - cornerRadius: Optional. Default to `2`mm. Corner radius used for type `3` above.
    - padSpacing: Optional. Defaults to `none`, which means pads are at the physical edge of the component. Use `edge` for edge-to-edge spacing 
    for physical pads, or `center` if datasheet uses center-to-center dimensions.
- tags: Optional. The word `inductor` as a tag is included already in the script. You should add the series name.
 

## CSV input files
The CSV format requires the following 6 columns, which can be in any order in the actual CSV file.

`PartNumber` - Part number that will be generated. This could be the unique part number,
or you can perform grouping if there are multiple parts sharing the same footprint.

`datasheetUrl` - Optional. If your parts have unique datasheets per part, you can specify it. Please use quotes for this column.

`lengthY`, `widthX` and `height` - physical dimensions of the inductor.

`padX` and `padY` - the dimensions of the actual pad on the component
`padSpacing` - the spacing between the actual pads

`landingX` and `landingY` - physical dimensions of the copper landing areas on the footprint
`landingSpacing` - the spacing between the copper landing areas. This can be center-to-center, or edge-to-edge (default). 
You should set the YAML file parameter accordingly based on what measurement the datasheet uses.

**Note** - you may need to swap the `length`/`width` values, and thus the `pad x`/`pad y` values.
The `lengthY` value should be the dimension/edge that shares the same side as the copper pads.

### Example
![Layout Example](layout1.png)

In this example from the SWPA series, the recommended land pattern is in the proper orientation (pads on the left/right) for this script.
- `A` is `widthX`
- `B` is `lengthY`
- `F` is `padSpacing`
- `E` is `padX`
- `D` is `padY`
- `b` becomes `padX`
- `c` is `padY`
- `a` is `landingSpacing`

In this datasheet, care must be taken to adjust the physical dimensions. Notice that `A` is X
since the land pattern is rotated to differ from the physical drawings.
